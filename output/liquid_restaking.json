As a liquid restaking platform for Ethereum, Eigenpieâ€™s core mechanism enables users to convert their Liquid Staked ETH tokens into Isolated Liquid Restaked ETH tokens. These are restaked versions of ETH LSTs, created by Eigenpie. This process allows users to earn passive income from Ethereum staking and EigenLayer revenue simultaneously, without requiring a lockup period."
