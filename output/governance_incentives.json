    "description": "Abacus is an optimization layer built on ve(3,3) protocols. We aim to pool our collective resources to bolster the ecosystems, and to provide a seamless integration for all users. Abacus deploys a liquid wrapper token system that unlocks veTOKENs, provides yield on top of them while building up it's own vePOSITION to vote with. Abacus votes every week with it's veNFT position, capturing fees and bribes from the exchange, and streaming them to it's users. Abacus's veNFT position grows steadily as exchange users exit their veTOKEN positions, enabling Abacus to capture more of the exchange's fees and bribes."

    "description": "Service Nervous Systems (SNSs) are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that allow developers to hand over their dapps to decentralized, token-based governance systems. SNSs enable Web3 services to be owned and governed by their communities, evolving through proposals that respond to the desires, feedback, and voting of those communities."
